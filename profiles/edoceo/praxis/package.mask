# Use this file to block packages from being installed
#   Lines are just the Portage atom

#  When you don't want Portage to take a certain package or a specific
#  version of a package into account you can mask it yourself by adding an
#  appropriate line to the /etc/portage/package.mask location (either in
#  that file or in a file in this directory).
